# Hello-World
How to intro to Git

I am a retired engineer who learned to code (we use to call this programming) originally in FORTRAN IV in 1967. Later I learned Pascal, C, and C++. I have an engineering program that computes settlement for various load distributions written in FORTRAN 77 that I want to convert to java or python.
